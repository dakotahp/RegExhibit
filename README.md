# Github Note
RegExhibit was created by Roger Jolly, not me. I have simple brought his source code to github so others can contribute and improve the app. If you fork this and make improvements, please send a pull request so we can have a central repo instead of disparate versions.

## About RegExhibit
RegExhibit is a program that allows you to interactively examine and test regular expressions. If you don’t know what regular expressions are, chances are this application is not for you.

I wrote this application mainly to help me learning objective-c and cocoa programming. As I am regularly using regular expressions, and dislike writing small test programs to see if they are correct, it seemed like a useful exercise.

While writing this, I profited a lot from the source-code and snippets other people had made available. It seems only fair, I should do the same.

## Price
RegExhibit and its source-code are free. If you feel they are worth something and you want to spend some money, donate it to your favourite charity. When you haven't got one, might I suggest Amnesty International? (Please note, Amnesty International has absolutely no connection with or responsibility for this application and can be blamed even less than I for what you do to your system with it.)

## Author
RegExhibit was written by Roger Jolly. As I am still learning objective-c / cocoa, chances are some things could have been done a lot smarter. If you have any suggestions, comments or whatever, I would like to hear from you. You can mail me at Roger_Jolly@mac.com.
